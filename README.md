# Machine-Learning-Basics

##Sentiment Analysis of Reviews in Amazon site
 •	Analyzed the review and came to the conclusion whether It's a positive review or a negative review. 
 •	Gave weights to the different words and analyzed different features in a sentence using graphlab create in python (a software provided by dato)
 
 
##Image Classification
 You’ve probably heard that Deep Learning is making news across the world as one of the most promising techniques in machine learning. Every industry is dedicating resources to unlock the deep learning potential, including for tasks such as image tagging, object recognition, speech recognition, and text analysis.

In our final case study, searching for images, this will be on how layers of neural networks provide very descriptive (non-linear) features that provide impressive performance in image classification and retrieval tasks. You will then construct deep features, a transfer learning technique that allows you to use deep learning very easily, even when you have little data to train the model.

Using iPython notebooks, this is build an image classifier and an intelligent image retrieval system with deep learning.

##Nearest Neighbor Model
In this module, we focused on using nearest neighbors and clustering to retrieve documents that interest users, by analyzing their text. We explored two document representations: word counts and TF-IDF. We also built an iPython notebook for retrieving articles from Wikipedia about famous people.

##Predicting House Prices
In this module, we focused on using regression to predict a continuous value (house prices) from features of the house (square feet of living space, number of bedrooms,...). We also built an iPython notebook for predicting house prices, using data from King County, USA, the region where the city of Seattle is located.
